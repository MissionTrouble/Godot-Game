# Dictionary Inspector.

Exactly what it sounds lke. It edits Dictionaries in the Inspector.

Notable differences from the janky 3.5 inspector:

- editable keys (!!!!!!)
- adding entries with one button, never forget to click "Add new k/v pair" again!
- when adding, just uses the last edited entry's key/value types

Other features:

- generic and pool arrays
- nested dictionaries
- resources (only drag-and-drop right now, but can multi-drop)
- enter expressions/GDScript inside float/vector/matrix editors (try it in vanilla godot too btw)
